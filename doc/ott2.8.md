## Contents
All files are encoded UTF-8.  For detailed documentation about file formats, see [documentation in the reference taxonomy
wiki](https://github.com/OpenTreeOfLife/reference-taxonomy/wiki/Interim-taxonomy-file-format),
on github.

**conflicts.tsv**: Report on taxa that are hidden because they are paraphyletic with respect to a higher priority taxon.  Number at beginning is height in taxonomic tree of nearest common ancestor with priority taxon that 'steals' one or more children.

**deprecated.tsv**: List all of taxa that have been deprecated since previous version. 

**differences.tsv:** Summary of differences between ott2.8 and ott2.7.

**hidden.tsv**: Report on 'hidden' taxa (incertae sedis and other suppressed taxa). Columns are OTT id, name, source taxonomy and id, containing major group, and flags (reasons for hiding).

**log.tsv**: Debugging information related to homonym resolution.

**taxonomy.tsv**: The file that contains the taxonomy. Columns are separated by vertical bars ('|'). Columns are:

  * uid - an identifier for the taxon, unique within this file. Should be native accession number whenever possible. Usually this is an integer, but it need not be. 
  * parent_uid - the identifier of this taxon's parent, or the empty string if there is no parent (i.e., it's a root).
  * name - arbitrary text for the taxon name; not necessarily unique within the file.
  * rank, e.g. species, family, class. If no rank is assigned, or the rank is unknown, contains "no rank".
  * sourceinfo - the source taxonomies providing the taxon.
  * uniqname - human friendly name providing homonym disambiguation.
  * flags - notable properties of this taxon, if any.

**synonyms.tsv**: The list of synonyms. Columns are separated by vertical bars ('|'). Columns are:

* uid - the id for the taxon (from taxonomy.tsv) that this synonym resolves to
* name - the synonymic taxon name
* type - typically will be 'synonym' but could be any of the NCBI synonym types (authority, common name, etc.)
* uniqname - name with name of target taxon

**version.tsv**: The version of OTT.

## Build script

The reference taxonomy is an algorithmic combination of several
source taxonomies.  For code,
see <a href="https://github.com/OpenTreeOfLife/reference-taxonomy">the
source code repository</a>.
Version 2.8 was generated using 
[commit f2ee381ef3c2d1806cd3d4b311124fb590aa2a42](https://github.com/OpenTreeOfLife/reference-taxonomy/commit/f2ee381ef3c2d1806cd3d4b311124fb590aa2a42).

Where taxonomies conflict regarding taxon relationships, they are
resolved in favor of the higher priority taxonomy.  The priority
ordering is as given below.

## Sources

Any errors in OTT
should be assumed to have been introduced by the Open Tree of Life 
project until confirmed as originating in the source taxonomy.
