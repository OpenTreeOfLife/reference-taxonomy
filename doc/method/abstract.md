Candidate title: A reference taxonomy for phylogenetic data aggregation


# Abstract

Taxonomy and nomenclature data are critical for any project that synthesizes
biodiversity data, as most biodiversity data sets use taxonomic names to
identify taxa. Open Tree of Life is one such project, synthesizing sets of
published phylogenetic trees into comprehensive supertrees. No single published
taxonomy met the taxonomic and nomenclatural needs of the project. We therefore
describe here a system for reproducibly combining several source taxonomies into
a synthetic taxonomy, and discuss the challenges of taxonomic and nomenclatural
synthesis for downstream biodiversity projects.
