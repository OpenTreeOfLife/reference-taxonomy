# Create your own edits file in this directory, don't edit this one.
# Comment lines begin with '#'.
# Include all columns for each line.
# Separate columns with tab characters, not spaces.
# Capitalization matters!  Generally speaking, taxon names are capitalized.
# Spacing matters!  Only one space between genus name and epithet.
# sourceInfo should be either a URL or an abbreviated URL such as ncbi:12345.
# If you want to put multiple sourceInfos, separate with commas,
# without any intervening spaces.
# Rank should be in lower case; use 'no rank' if unknown or rank-free.
#
# Commands are add, move, synonym, prune, fold, flag
#
# The commands that used to be in this file have been moved to misc_edits.tsv.
#
# E.g. (without the # signs)
#command	name	rank	parent	context	sourceInfo
#add	Acanthotrema frischii	species	Acanthotrema	Fungi	if:516851
