# Conclusions

We have presented a method for merging multiple taxonomies into a single
synthetic taxonomy. The method is designed to produce a taxonomy optimized for
the Open Tree of Life phylogeny synthesis project. Most taxonomy projects are
databases of taxonomy information that are continuously updated by curators as
new information is published in the taxonomic literature. In contrast, the Open
Tree Taxonomy takes several of these curated taxonomies and assembles a synthetic
taxonomy _de novo_ each time a new version of the taxonomy is needed.

We have also developed a system for curators to directly add new taxa to the
taxonomy from published phylogenies. These taxon additions include provenance
information, including the source of the taxon and identity of the curator. We
expose this provenance information through the website and the taxonomy API.
Most of the Open Tree feedback has been about taxonomy, and expanding this
feature to other types of taxonomic information allows users to directly
contribute expertise and allows projects to easily share that information.

Taxonomic information is certainly best curated at a scale smaller than "all
life" by experts in a particular group. Therefore, producing comprehensive
taxonomies should be a synthesis of curated taxonomies. We advocate for the type
of methods being used by Open Tree and by GBIF, where synthesis is done in a
repeatable fashion from sources, allowing changed information in sources to be
quickly included in the comprehensive taxonomy. Provenance information is
retained and presented as part of the synthetic taxonomy. This type
of synthesis requires that source taxonomies be available online, either through
APIs or by bulk download, in a format that can be easily parsed, and ideally
without terms of use that prevent distribution and reuse of the resulting
synthetic taxonomies.
