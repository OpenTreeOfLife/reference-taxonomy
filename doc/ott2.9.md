(Peter delivered to JAR on August 5)

  - Newer version of Index Fungorum - from August
  - WoRMS, which Keith is reviewing now
  - moved all of the non-fungal content from Index Fungorum to a low priority position, below NCBI. formerly it was taking priority over NCBI. 
  - and I will update to the latest version of NCBI taxonomy of course.
