# Capitalization matters!  Generally speaking, taxon names are capitalized.
# Spacing matters!  Only one space between genus name and epithet.
# sourceInfo should be either a URL or an abbreviated URL such as ncbi:12345.
# If you want to put multiple sourceInfos, separate with commas,
# without any intervening spaces.
# Rank should be in lower case; use 'no rank' if unknown or rank-free.
