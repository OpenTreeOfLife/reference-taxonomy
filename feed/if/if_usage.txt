if.py A tool to generate smasher files from Index Fungorum exports

This tool uses two input files, each reflecting a table in the IF database.
The first file (by default qryAAA-ExportIF-2.txt) is a list of names,
with authority information, ID and links to the linage table filling out
row.  Note that the CurrentNameID may not be present, and if it is, it may or
may not match the IF-ID.  If they match, the name is valid and not a synonym.
If they differ, the name is a synonym and the CurrentNameID points to another
name of which the first is a synonym.  Note that it may take several levels of
indirection to find the currently valid name for a synonym.  Names without a 
CurrentNameID have "no associated taxonomic opinion (the 'valid' in zoological
terms)", but are currently treated the same as names where the IF-ID and 
CurrentNameID match (so the process is liberal in passing names through).

The second file (by default qryAAA-ExportFDC-2.txt) is a list of lineages,
starting at the genus level, working up the hierarchy along each row.  The last
column is the lineage id.

The tool produces a log file (if.log by default), a taxonomy.tsv and synonyms.tsv
file that correspond to other smasher input files.

The invocation syntax is:
python if.py [if_file fdc_file [log_file [taxonomy_results synonym_results]]]
