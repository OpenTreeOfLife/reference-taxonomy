About the contents of this data package
---------------------------------------

For further information on the original taxonomy sources see the article.

For the scripts that convert the original sources (on the web) to
their processed versions (in this data package), see the Makefile and
the feed/ directory in the code repository (in Zenodo, [ref zenodo
deposit DOI]).

For documentation on taxonomy file formats, see [ref zenodo, after
moving these from wiki to repo].

This data package archives the processed versions of the taxonomies,
not the original sources.  Information about sources is provided.

"Source date" refers to the write date of the source file.  "Access
date" is the date on which the source file was retrieved.

All files are GNU 'tar' archives, compressed using gzip compression.
